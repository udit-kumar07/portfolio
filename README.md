# portfolio
To complete this task, I built a portfolio website using Flask.
First, I set up a virtual environment and installed Flask, then created an portfolio.py file to handle routes for the homepage, projects, and a contact form.
I designed the webpage using HTML templates with Jinja2 for dynamic content and added a CSS file for styling. 
The homepage displays my projects with GitHub links, and the contact form saves messages into a CSV file. 
After testing locally by running python portfolio.py, I verified that the portfolio and form work correctly. 
Finally, I organized the project with templates/ and static/ folders, added a README.md, created a GitHub repository, and pushed the code successfully.
